# QR Code Genrator

Creating a QR code generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a simple web application. HTML is used for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to generate QR codes. Users typically input data, such as a URL or text, into a form, and upon submission, JavaScript is used to generate the QR code image dynamically. The generated QR code can be displayed on the webpage for users to scan or download. This minimalist setup allows users to easily create QR codes for various purposes directly from their web browser.
